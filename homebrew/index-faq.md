<summary><h2>What is Homebrew?</h2></summary>
<p>
Homebrew is a package manager for macOS (and Linux, too). It is one of the first tools you'll need to set up a local development environment for programming on a Mac. Use it to install (and remove) software programs for the terminal, or command line. It is like an app store for programming tools (but everything is free). MacOS includes some pre-installed programming languages and command line utilities but most work requires newer versions of languages and tools not provided by Apple. Get what you need with Homebrew. Almost every useful open source program (or "package") is available through Homebrew, with a single tool to install and manage each one. Homebrew's biggest drawback? A cute terminology of kegs, casks, bottles, and other beer-themed terms, explained here.

<summary><h2>What (and where) is the macOS Terminal?</h2></summary>
<p>
Every Mac comes with a pre-installed Terminal application. Use it to run software (or software commands) without a graphical interface, using the <em>command line interface</em>. The Terminal application or <em>console</em> gives us access to the Unix command line, or <em>shell</em>. Look in the `Applications/Utilities/` folder for the Terminal application or click the Spotlight icon in the menu bar and type "terminal." If you see "terminal," double-click the search result to launch the terminal. See <a href="/ruby/15.html">Finding and Using the macOS Terminal</a>.
