<summary><h2>What (and where) is the macOS Terminal?</h2></summary>
<p>
Every Mac comes with a pre-installed Terminal application. Use it to run software (or software commands) without a graphical interface, using the <em>command line interface</em>. The Terminal application or <em>console</em> gives us access to the Unix command line, or <em>shell</em>. Look in the `Applications/Utilities/` folder for the Terminal application or click the Spotlight icon in the menu bar and type "terminal." If you see "terminal," double-click the search result to launch the terminal. See <a href="/ruby/15.html">Finding and Using the macOS Terminal</a>.
