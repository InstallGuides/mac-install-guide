## Install a Homebrew Package

Here's how to install a package with Homebrew on a Mac using `brew install`.

### Brew search

The README or installation instructions for various languages or tools will often mention how to install from Homebrew. Or you can use `brew search` to see if a package is available.

```bash
$ brew search tree
==> Formulae
as-tree             pstree              tree-sitter         treefrog
cherrytree          tree ‚úî              treecc
```

A search will show the "formulae" (packages) that are available for installation. A checkmark `‚úî` will indicate a package is already installed on your machine.

### Brew list

Use `brew list` to see all the packages you've installed.

```bash
$ brew list
```

### Brew update

Before you install any software package with Homebrew, run `brew update` to update Homebrew. Updating Homebrew can take many minutes, so run the update before trying to install a package. It is better to run the update yourself rather than waiting for Homebrew to run the updates automatically. This will update any core dependencies that your package may need.

```bash
$ brew update
Already up-to-date.
```

This updates Homebrew itself. It can take many minutes to run an update.

Homebrew core packages are updated as often as every day, so it is likely you will see updates.

### Brew doctor

Before you install any software package with Homebrew, run `brew doctor` to check that Homebrew is ready to install a package.

```bash
$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.
```

### Brew install

Now you can install a software package with `brew install <package>`. For example, here's how to install the `tree` package (a useful Unix command that displays directories and files as a diagram).

```bash
$ brew install tree
==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/tree/manifests/1.8.0
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/tree/blobs/sha256:b9d1925b5b306
==> Downloading from https://pkg-containers.githubusercontent.com/ghcr1/blobs/sh
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring tree--1.8.0.arm64_big_sur.bottle.tar.gz
üç∫  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tree/1.8.0: 8 files, 158.5KB
```

The console will show the downloaded files and dependencies. The console also shows the location of the installed package (Homebrew calls it a "keg").

The console may show post-install instructions labelled "Caveat." It is important to read the "Caveat" though sometimes it is cryptic.

Sometimes a language or software package requires post-install steps, usually to set a shell configuration. Often, the post-install instructions are found only on the package website. The [Homebrew maintainers say](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/54315) that general post-install instructions should be covered in documentation, not in caveats. Caveats are only for Homebrew-specific quirks or issues. If a package doesn't work after installation, check the installation instructions to see if you must configure the shell or `$PATH` variable in the  `~/.zprofile` or  `~/.zshrc` file.

#### Install a specific version with Homebrew

You may wish to install a specific version of a package using Homebrew. For example, Ruby 3.0 may be the newest version installed by Homebrew but you need to work on an application that requires Ruby 2.7.3. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to install an older package version with Homebrew. Blog posts by [Christoph Michel](https://cmichel.io/how-to-install-an-old-package-version-with-brew/) and [Remarkablemark](https://remarkablemark.org/blog/2017/02/03/install-brew-package-version/) detail a complex hack to install older package versions. Really, it's better to use Homebrew to install a version manager that allows installation and switching among different versions. You can [Install Asdf](https://mac.install.guide/ruby/5.html) if you are working with multiple languages and multiple versions (for example, Ruby and Node).

### Verify with `brew list`

After installing a package, use `brew list <formula>` to verify that it has been installed. You'll see all the installed files.

```bash
$ brew list tree
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/tree/1.8.0/bin/tree
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/tree/1.8.0/share/man/man1/tree.1
```

You can also see a list of dependencies for the package.

```bash
$ brew deps <formula>
```

### Brew pin

Some packages (particularly programming languages such as Ruby or Python) are dependencies of other packages. They may be automatically upgraded during the installation of another package. If you must use only the currently installed version of a package, you can block automatic updates using `brew pin <formula>`. For example, pin Ruby so that a newer version cannot be automatically installed:

```bash
$ brew pin ruby
```

The command will not show a response but you can verify with `brew info <formula>`.

```bash
$ brew info tree
tree: stable 1.8.0 (bottled) [pinned at 1.8.0]
.
.
.
```

You can remove the pin when you wish to install a newer version of a package.

```bash
$ brew unpin tree
$ brew info tree
tree: stable 1.8.0 (bottled)
.
.
.
```

You'll need to run `brew info <formula>` to see the changed status.

### Upgrade a package

Use `brew upgrade` to install the newest version of a package.

Homebrew is designed to install the latest stable version of any package. There is no practical way to upgrade to a specific version that is not the version chosen by Homebrew.

```bash
$ brew upgrade <package>
```

Note that `brew update` and `brew upgrade` are different. _Update_ is for Homebrew itself. _Upgrade_ is for individual software packages.
