## Update Homebrew

Here is how to update Homebrew on a Mac.

Before you install any software package with Homebrew, you should run a command to update Homebrew and check that it is ready to install a package. Homebrew will automatically run these checks before installing a package but it is better to run these checks separately. Updating Homebrew can take many minutes, so run the update before trying to install a package.

```bash
$ brew update
Already up-to-date.
```

Homebrew core packages are updated as often as every day, so it is likely you will see updates.

After you update Homebrew, run diagnostics.

```bash
$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.
```

As you use Homebrew, it is helpful to see a list of all the packages you've installed:

```bash
$ brew list
```

You can also see a diagram of packages and dependencies.

```bash
$ brew deps --tree --installed
```

Immediately after installation, these commands show nothing is installed.

Now you can use Homebrew to install packages.
