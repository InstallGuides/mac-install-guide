## Update Homebrew

Here's how to update Homebrew on a Mac using `brew update`.

### Brew update

Before you install any software package with Homebrew, run a command to update Homebrew and check that it is ready to install a package. Updating Homebrew can take many minutes, so run the update before trying to install a package. It is better to run these checks yourself rather than waiting for Homebrew to run the updates automatically.

```bash
$ brew update
Already up-to-date.
```

This updates Homebrew itself. It can take many minutes to run an update.

Homebrew core packages are updated as often as every day, so it is likely you will see updates.

### Brew doctor

After you update Homebrew, run diagnostics.

```bash
$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.
```

### Upgrade packages

It is important to know that `brew update` and `brew upgrade` are different. _Update_ is for Homebrew itself. _Upgrade_ is for individual software packages. You won't need to bring software packages up to date until you need the latest versions, so you may not run this command often.

Here's how to install the newest version of a package:

```bash
$ brew upgrade <package>
```

Install the newest version of _all_ packages:

```bash
$ brew upgrade
```

You must allow time to upgrade all packages. It can take many minutes.

### Brew list

As you use Homebrew, it is helpful to see a list of all the packages you've installed:

```bash
$ brew list
```

You can also see a diagram of packages and dependencies.

```bash
$ brew deps --tree --installed
```

Immediately after installation, these commands show nothing is installed.

Before you use Homebrew to install packages, learn how to uninstall Homebrew when you need to.
