## Uninstall Homebrew

Here's how to uninstall Homebrew on a Mac.

You may need to uninstall Homebrew if:
- Homebrew isn't behaving as you expect and you want to install it from scratch.
- You are no longer using Homebrew and you want to free storage space.
- You want to use a different package manager (for example, [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/), [Fink](https://www.finkproject.org/), or [pkgin](https://pkgin.net/)).

### Steps

Here are the steps to remove Homebrew from a Mac.
- Uninstall Homebrew using the official uninstall script.
- Remove Homebrew shell configuration (Apple silicon only).

### Official uninstall script

Homebrew provides an official uninstall script. Check the [Homebrew GitHub repository] to see if it has changed.

```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
```

It's easy to run the command directly in your terminal.

Or download the uninstall script with a `-O` option to save using a default file name.

```bash
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh
```

Then run `/bin/bash uninstall.sh --help` to view uninstall options. You'll see this:

```bash
$ /bin/bash uninstall.sh --help
Homebrew Uninstaller
Usage: uninstall.sh [options]
    -p, --path=PATH  Sets Homebrew prefix. Defaults to /usr/local.
        --skip-cache-and-logs Skips removal of HOMEBREW_CACHE and HOMEBREW_LOGS.
    -f, --force      Uninstall without prompting.
    -q, --quiet      Suppress all output.
    -n, --dry-run    Simulate uninstall but don't remove anything.
    -h, --help       Display this message.
```

The uninstall script removes all Homebrew files, including installed packages in the `/opt/homebrew/` (Apple silicon) or `/usr/local/` (Mac Intel) directories. It doesn't remove the shell configuration required to run Homebrew.

### Remove Homebrew shell configuration

On Apple silicon, the Homebrew shell configuration sets the `$PATH` variable so Homebrew packages in the `/opt/homebrew/`  directory will be found and given priority in the terminal. No shell configuration is needed on Mac Intel because the `/usr/local/` directory is included in the default `$PATH` variable.

By default, the `~/.zprofile` file will contain configuration commands. Use the `cat` command to display the contents of the file.

```bash
$ cat ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Remove the line that contains `brew shellenv`. If you haven't installed a favorite text editor, `open ~/.zprofile` opens TextEdit so you can edit the file. You can remove the file with `rm  ~/.zprofile` if it contains only the Homebrew shell configuration.

Though the `~/.zprofile` file is recommended, Homebrew may have been installed without the `~/.zprofile` file to set the shell configuration. If Homebrew is working but the `~/.zprofile` file does not contain the `brew shellenv` command, check the other startup files that configure Zsh (listed below in the order they are sourced).
- `~/.zshenv` - sourced every time a shell is launched
- `~/.zprofile` - sourced before `~/.zshrc`, read only on login and intended for a user (not read by scripts)
- `~/.zshrc` - the most common location for zsh configuration settings (for a user, not read by scripts)
- `~/.zlogin` - sourced after `~/.zshrc` and intended for remote login to a shell

In all likelihood, Homebrew shell configuration is set in `~/.zprofile` or  `~/.zshrc`. There's also a possibility that shell configuration is set by [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), an advanced framework for managing a Zsh configuration.

If you don't remove the Homebrew shell configuration and you've removed Homebrew, you'll see a warning message every time you start a terminal session.

### Done!

That's it! You've uninstalled Homebrew.
