## Xcode Command Line Tools Already Installed?

To avoid complications, it's best to check if Xcode Command Line Tools are already installed. If already installed, check if you have the most recent version.

If you updated your machine from an earlier macOS version, you may have an outdated version of Xcode or the Command Line Tools in place. Read on to check if you have a troublesome out-of-date Command Line Tools.

### Is Xcode already installed?

If you updated macOS from an earlier version with an "over the top" installation, your earlier development environment may remain intact. You will need to install the new version of Xcode Command Line Tools to avoid headaches. First, check what you have.

Check if you previously installed the full Xcode package:

```bash
$ xcode-select -p
```

#### Scenario 1

If you see, `xcode-select: error: unable to get active developer directory...`, the Xcode package is not installed.

Good! Jump to either section:
- [Install Xcode Command Line Tools with Homebrew](/commandlinetools/3.html) (recommended)
- [Install Xcode Command Line Tools Directly](/commandlinetools/4.html) (alternative).

*The Xcode package is not installed*

#### Scenario 2

If you see a file location that contains spaces in the path:

```bash
/Applications/Apple Dev Tools/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

you will have problems installing Homebrew. You should [delete Xcode](/commandlinetools/7.html) before continuing.

#### Scenario 3

If you see:

```bash
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

The full Xcode package is already installed. Perhaps you installed it previously. If Xcode is installed, you will need to update Xcode to the newest version. Go to the App Store application and check "Updates." After updating Xcode, be sure to launch the Xcode application and accept the Apple license terms.

#### Scenario 4

If you see:

```bash
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

The Xcode Command Line Tools may be installed or an empty directory may be present.

Here's how to test:

```bash
$ ls /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/git
```

You should see:

```bash
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/git
```

#### Remove an empty folder

If the Xcode Command Line Tools folder is empty, you should remove it.

Remove the empty folder:

```bash
$ sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

Use `sudo` for admin access. You must enter the password you use to log in to your computer (you will not see the password after entering it). After removing the folder, continue to the section, [Install Xcode Command Line Tools with Homebrew](/commandlinetools/3.html).

### Check the Xcode Command Line Tools version

There is no easy way to directly check the version number of Xcode Command Line Tools installed on your machine. Instead, check the version of clang by running `clang --version` in the terminal application. The Wikipedia page for [Xcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode) shows the version number of the latest Xcode release and the corresponding clang version.

Check the clang version:

```bash
$ clang --version
Apple clang version 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.9)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin20.4.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```

Check the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode) to see if you've got the latest version.

If Xcode Command Line Tools are installed and up to date, you're done!

You may want to [Install Homebrew](/homebrew/index.html) to continue setting up your development environment.
