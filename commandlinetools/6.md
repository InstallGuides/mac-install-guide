## Reinstall Xcode Command Line Tools

After a macOS upgrade (for example, from macOS 11.2.2 to 11.2.3), the upgrade process may remove the Command Line Tools. This can be annoying if you install an upgrade and then find you can't use commands such as `git`. You may encounter an error like:

```bash
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools),
missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun
```

Checking for the Command Line Tools folder may show that the folder is there:

```bash
$ xcode-select -p
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

But look closely and the Command Line Tools folder may be missing essential folders and files after a macOS upgrade. It should look like this:

```bash
$ ls -l /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  5 root  wheel  160 Jan  9 07:43 Library
drwxr-xr-x  5 root  wheel  160 Apr 24 16:19 SDKs
drwxr-xr-x  7 root  wheel  224 Apr 24 16:19 usr
```

It may look like this after an upgrade:

```bash
$ ls -l /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  7 root  wheel  224 Apr 24 16:19 usr
```

Homebrew is installed but `brew doctor` will show problems:

```bash
% brew doctor

Warning: Git could not be found in your PATH.
Homebrew uses Git for several internal functions, and some formulae use Git
checkouts instead of stable tarballs. You may want to install Git:
  brew install git

Warning: No developer tools installed.
Install the Command Line Tools:
  xcode-select --install
```

You've already installed Homebrew and allowed Homebrew to install Xcode Command Line Tools. Now you must re-install Xcode Command Line Tools from the command line:

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

A message will pop up on the screen. Confirm that you want to install the tools.

You'll see a progress indicator as the software downloads.

Finally you'll see a confirmation that the software was installed.

Verify that you've successfully installed Xcode Command Line Tools.

```bash
$ xcode-select -p
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

Check that you can run `git`:

```bash
git --version
git version 2.30.1 (Apple Git-130)
```
