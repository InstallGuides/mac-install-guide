## Install Homebrew

Developers use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) utility to install various Unix software packages. If you haven't already installed Xcode Command Line Tools, Homebrew will install it.

Tip: If you did not use a password to log in to your Mac (that is, if your password is blank), you cannot install Homebrew.

Check if Homebrew is installed:

```bash
$ brew
```

Homebrew is not installed if you see:

```bash
zsh: command not found: brew
```

Install Homebrew:

```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You'll see a list of files and folders that Homebrew will install. If you haven't already installed XCode CommandLine Tools, you'll see a message that "The XCode Command Line Tools will be installed." Press return to continue when prompted by the Homebrew installation script. It takes five to ten minutes to download and install the Command Line Tools.

The Homebrew installation script will ask you to enter your Mac user password.

```bash
Password:ðŸ”‘
```

You won't see the characters as you type. Press enter when you are done.

Homebrew installation takes many minutes (youâ€™ll see diagnostic and progress messages).

After you've installed Homebrew, check that Homebrew is installed properly.

```bash
$ brew doctor
```

You should see:

```bash
Your system is ready to brew.
```

### Verify Command Line Tools

Verify that you've successfully installed Xcode Command Line Tools.

```bash
$ xcode-select -p
```

You should see:
```bash

/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

Just to be certain, verify that the Command Line Tools executables are available:

```bash
$ /usr/sbin/pkgutil --packages | grep CL
```

You should see:

```bash
com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables
```

Also try:

```bash
$ /usr/sbin/pkgutil --pkg-info com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables
```

You should see:

```bash
package-id: com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables
```

If the Command Line Tools executables are available, you'll have no problem installing Ruby and compiling gems that require native extensions.

Next we'll configure Git, an essential tool for any developer.
