## Install Homebrew

Developers use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) utility to install various Unix software packages. If you haven't already installed Xcode Command Line Tools, Homebrew will install it.

Tip: If you did not use a password to log in to your Mac (that is, if your password is blank), you cannot install Homebrew.

Check if Homebrew is installed:

```bash
$ brew
```

Homebrew is not installed if you see:

```bash
zsh: command not found: brew
```

If Homebrew is not installed, there should be no Homebrew files in  `/usr/local` (for macOS Intel) or `/opt/homebrew` (for Apple Silicon).

Homebrew provides an installation script (check that it hasn't changed at the [Homebrew site](https://brew.sh/)).

```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

The Homebrew installation script will ask you to enter your Mac user password.

```bash
Password:ðŸ”‘
```

You won't see the characters as you type. Press enter when you are done.

You'll see a list of files and folders that Homebrew will install. If you haven't already installed XCode CommandLine Tools, you'll see a message that "The XCode Command Line Tools will be installed." Press return to continue when prompted by the Homebrew installation script. It takes five to ten minutes to download and install the Command Line Tools.

Homebrew installation takes many minutes (youâ€™ll see diagnostic and progress messages).

After you've installed Homebrew, check that Homebrew is installed properly.

```bash
$ brew doctor
```

You should see:

```bash
Your system is ready to brew.
```

Next we'll configure Git, an essential tool for any developer. But first, be aware that you may have to reinstall Command Line Tools after a macOS upgrade.

### After a macOS Upgrade

After a macOS upgrade (for example, from macOS 11.2.2 to 11.2.3), the upgrade process may remove the Command Line Tools. This can be annoying if you install an upgrade and then find you can't use commands such as `git`. You may encounter an error like:

```bash
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools),
missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun
```

Checking for the Command Line Tools folder may show that the folder is there:

```bash
$ xcode-select -p
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

But look closely and the Command Line Tools folder may be missing essential folders and files after a macOS upgrade. It should look like this:

```bash
$ ls -l /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  5 root  wheel  160 Jan  9 07:43 Library
drwxr-xr-x  5 root  wheel  160 Apr 24 16:19 SDKs
drwxr-xr-x  7 root  wheel  224 Apr 24 16:19 usr
```

It may look like this after an upgrade:

```bash
$ ls -l /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  7 root  wheel  224 Apr 24 16:19 usr
```

Homebrew is installed but `brew doctor` will show problems:

```bash
% brew doctor

Warning: Git could not be found in your PATH.
Homebrew uses Git for several internal functions, and some formulae use Git
checkouts instead of stable tarballs. You may want to install Git:
  brew install git

Warning: No developer tools installed.
Install the Command Line Tools:
  xcode-select --install
```

You've already installed Homebrew and allowed Homebrew to install Xcode Command Line Tools. Now you must re-install Xcode Command Line Tools from the command line:

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

A message will pop up on the screen. Confirm that you want to install the tools.

You'll see a progress indicator as the software downloads.

Finally you'll see a confirmation that the software was installed.

Verify that you've successfully installed Xcode Command Line Tools.

```bash
$ xcode-select -p
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

Check that you can run `git`:

```bash
git --version
git version 2.30.1 (Apple Git-130)
```

You've seen how to reinstall Command Line Tools after a macOS upgrade.

Next, if you haven't already done so, we'll configure Git, an essential tool for any developer.
