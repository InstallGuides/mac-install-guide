## Install Ruby with Frum

If you are a casual user and won't be using Ruby frequently, you can use Homebrew to install Ruby. See the section, [Install Ruby with Homebrew](/ruby/13.html). Most developers should install a software version manager before installing Ruby. It will help you manage multiple versions of Ruby. I recommend [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). Asdf can manage versions of many languages, including Ruby and Node. Instructions for asdf are in the section, [Asdf Version Manager](/ruby/5.html).

If you don't want to use asdf, or if you have problems with it, I recommend [Frum](https://github.com/TaKO8Ki/frum), as it is the newest and fastest Ruby version manager. The Frum version manager is added to your shell to intercept any calls to Ruby. [Chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) is also good (see [Install Ruby with Chruby](https://mac.install.guide/ruby/12.html)). [Rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [rvm](https://rvm.io/) are also popular as Ruby version managers. Sam Stephenson's Rbenv is more complex than Frum or Chruby (it installs extra ‚Äúshim‚Äù files). RVM was once the most popular of Ruby version managers but its additional features (its gemsets) are no longer needed and it adds unnecessary complexity.

Here are instructions for installing Frum and Ruby.

### Mac system Ruby

MacOS comes with a "system Ruby" pre-installed. MacOS Big Sur and Catalina include Ruby 2.6.3 which is not the newest version. It's a bad idea to use the Mac system Ruby. See the article [Do not use the MacOS system Ruby](/faq/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby/index.html). You can see the system Ruby with `which ruby` and `ruby -v`.

Leave the system Ruby in place and install the Frum version manager and the newest Ruby version.

### Install Frum

Use Homebrew to install the [Frum](https://github.com/TaKO8Ki/frum) Ruby version manager.

```bash
$ brew install tako8ki/tap/frum
```

You'll see beer mug emojis as Homebrew installs the utility.

Verify that Frum is available by running `brew list frum`:

```bash
$ brew list frum
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/frum/0.1.0/bin/frum
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/frum/0.1.0/etc/bash_completion.d/frum
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/frum/0.1.0/share/zsh/site-functions/_frum
```

We must add Frum to the system environment before we can use it to manage Ruby versions.

### Add Frum to the .zshrc file

Edit the `.zshrc` file in your text editor. If you haven‚Äôt installed a text editor, use the macOS TextEdit application. Here‚Äôs a shortcut to open the file in TextEdit from the Terminal:

```bash
$ open -e .zshrc
```

Add configuration commands for Frum:

```bash
### ~/.zshrc~
# enable frum
eval "$(frum init)"
```

The first two lines (with the hash characters) are comments. The third line makes the Frum program available in the shell.

Save the file.

üö© Close and reopen the Terminal window for the changes to the `.zshrc` file to be recognized.

After closing and reopening the Terminal window, use `frum -h` to check that Frum was installed successfully.

Next we'll install Ruby.

## Install Ruby

Frum has its own Ruby installation command. No extra software is needed to install Frum.

Use the command `frum install -l` to list all available Ruby versions.

```bash
$ frum install -l
```

You can check online for the current [recommended version of Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

When this was written, Ruby 3.0.1 was the newest version (Ruby 3.0.0 was released on Dec 25, 2020).

Use `frum install 3.0.1` to install the newest Ruby version.

```bash
$ frum install 3.0.1
```

You‚Äôll see diagnostic messages and progress updates. Installation is relatively fast with Frum; it will take about five minutes.

üö© After installation, close and re-open the terminal window.

Verify that the newest version of Ruby is installed with `ruby -v`.

When this was written, Ruby 3.0.1 was the newest version.

If you see Ruby version 2.6.3, it is the system Ruby and you likely forgot to close and re-open the terminal window.

The [Tips: Uninstalling Ruby](/ruby/9.html) section explains where Ruby versions are installed and how to remove them.

Next, you can optimize the Ruby development environment by updating gems. See the [Update Gems](/ruby/7.html) section.
