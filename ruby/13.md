## Install Ruby with Homebrew

Here are instructions for `brew install ruby`, or how to install Ruby with Homebrew.

### Steps

This is a complete guide to installing Ruby with Homebrew on a Mac.
- Update macOS for Ruby.
- Install Homebrew.
- Install Ruby.
- Update settings in the `~/.zshrc` file.

### Who this is for

Use Homebrew to install Ruby if you are a casual user and won't be using Ruby frequently. For example:
- you are just learning the language;
- you are building only one project.

There are drawbacks to using a version of Ruby that is installed with Homebrew:
- Homebrew may update Ruby to a new version when you upgrade other Homebrew packages;
- you can't switch between multiple Ruby versions.

Most developers use a software version manager to install Ruby. It will help you manage multiple versions of Ruby. I recommend [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). Asdf can manage versions of many languages, including Ruby and Node. See instructions, [Install Asdf Version Manager](/ruby/5.html). If you will only develop in Ruby, I recommend Frum, the newest and fastest Ruby version manager. See [Install Ruby with Frum](/ruby/14.html).

### Mac system Ruby

MacOS comes with a "system Ruby" pre-installed. MacOS Big Sur and Catalina include Ruby 2.6.3 which is not the newest version. It's a bad idea to use the Mac system Ruby. See the article [Do not use the MacOS system Ruby](/faq/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby/index.html). You can see the system Ruby with `which ruby` and `ruby -v`.

Leave the system Ruby in place and install the newest Ruby version using Homebrew.

## Install Homebrew

Complete the section, [Install Homebrew](/ruby/3.html), before you start.

## Install Ruby

Use Homebrew to install the newest Ruby version.

```bash
$ brew install ruby
```

Youâ€™ll see diagnostic messages and progress updates.

### Configure the .zshrc file

Edit the `~/.zshrc` file in your text editor. If you havenâ€™t installed a text editor, use the macOS TextEdit application. Hereâ€™s a shortcut to open the file in TextEdit from the Terminal:

```bash
$ open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Set the PATH environment variable.

```bash
### ~/.zshrc~
if [ -d "/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```

This sets the Homebrew-installed Ruby to a higher priority than the system Ruby and adds the directory used for Ruby gems.

Save the file.

ðŸš© Close and reopen the Terminal window for the changes to the `~/.zshrc` file to be recognized.

Verify that the newest version of Ruby is installed with `ruby -v`.

When this was written, Ruby 3.0.0 was the newest version (released on Dec 25, 2020).

If you see Ruby version 2.6.3, it is the system Ruby. Try closing and re-opening the terminal window.

Next, you can optimize the Ruby development environment by updating gems. See the [Update Gems](/ruby/7.html) section.
