<summary><h2>Can I use the Mac system Ruby?</h2></summary>
<p>MacOS comes with a "system Ruby" pre-installed. It's fine to use the system Ruby for running Ruby applications such as sysadmin scripts but you should not use it when you are developing projects in Ruby. Instead, you should [Install Ruby with Homebrew](/ruby/13.html) or use a version manager such as asdf, chruby, rbenv, or rvm (see a discussion above for the best version manager for Ruby). See the article [Do Not Use the MacOS System Ruby](/faq/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby/index.html) for reasons. Basically, the system Ruby is there for macOS, not for you.</p>
