## Tips: Removing Ruby

### Removing Ruby (asdf)

If you have installed Ruby using asdf, first list all installed versions.

```bash
$ asdf list ruby
2.7.2
```

Then uninstall any version.

```bash
$ asdf uninstall ruby 2.7.2
```

### Removing Ruby (Chruby)

Chruby installs versions of Ruby in the `~/.rubies/` folder, so version 2.7.2 is in the `~/.rubies/ruby-2.7.2` folder. Gems for the version are in the `~/.gem/ruby/2.7.2/gems` folder.

If you wish to remove a Ruby version, you can run:

```bash
$ rm -rf ~/.rubies/ruby-2.7.2
$ rm -rf ~/.gem/ruby/ruby-2.7.2
```

### Removing Ruby (Homebrew)

If you have installed Ruby using Homebrew, you can uninstall with:

```bash
$ brew uninstall ruby
```

You can also remove the configuration from the  `.zshrc` file.

```bash
### ~/.zshrc~
if [ -d "/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```
