## Asdf Software Version Manager

Most developers should install a software version manager before installing Ruby. It will help you manage multiple versions of Ruby. You will need to install newer Ruby versions as they are released. And you will need a version manager if you maintain older Ruby applications.

For a software version manager, I recommend [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). Asdf can manage versions of many languages, including Ruby and Node.

In the past, I recommended [Chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby), as it is the smallest and most efficient Ruby version manager. If you don't want to use asdf, or if you have problems with it, see instructions for installing Chruby in the section, [Install Ruby with the Chruby Version Manager](/ruby/12.html). Other alternatives are RVM and rbenv. [RVM](https://rvm.io/) was popular in the past but its additional features (its gemsets) are no longer needed and it adds unnecessary complexity. Sam Stephenson's [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) is also popular, but requires extra steps as you work (the rehash command), extra files (“shims”), and modifies gems when you install them.

If you are a casual user and won't be using Ruby frequently, you can use Homebrew to install Ruby. See the section, [Install Ruby with Homebrew](/ruby/13.html).

### Install dependencies

First, use Homebrew to install dependencies required by asdf.

```bash
$ brew install coreutils curl git
```

You'll also need the gnupg package if you need to install Node (if you need to develop with JavaScript in your local environment).

```bash
$ brew install gnupg
```

### Install asdf

You can install asdf using Homebrew.

```bash
$ brew install asdf
```

We must add asdf to the system environment before we can use it to manage Ruby versions.

### Add asdf to the .zshrc file

Use a shortcut to configure your shell to use asdf:

```bash
$ echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/asdf.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Check the `.zshrc` file.

```bash
$ cat ~/.zshrc
```

You should see configuration commands for asdf:

```bash
. /usr/local/opt/asdf/asdf.sh
```

Configuration for asdf should always be the last line in the `.zshrc` file, after setting any `$PATH` configuration.

🚩 Close and reopen the Terminal window for the changes to the `.zshrc` file to be recognized.

After closing and reopening the Terminal window, use `asdf --version` to check that asdf was installed successfully.

```bash
$ asdf --version
v0.8.0
```

### Add the .asdfrc configuration file

Add a `.asdfrc` configuration file to your user home directory to enable asdf to read `.ruby-version` files. This is helpful with projects that use a `.ruby-version` file to specify a Ruby version.

```bash
$ echo "legacy_version_file = yes" >> ~/.asdfrc
```

Confirm the creation of the configuration file.

```bash
$ cat ~/.asdfrc
legacy_version_file = yes
```

Now you can install the newest Ruby version.
