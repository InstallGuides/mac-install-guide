## Uninstall Ruby

### Uninstall Ruby (asdf)

If you have installed Ruby using asdf, first list all installed versions.

```bash
$ asdf list ruby
3.0.0
```

Then uninstall any version.

```bash
$ asdf uninstall ruby 3.0.0
```

### Uninstall Ruby (Chruby)

Chruby installs versions of Ruby in the `~/.rubies/` folder, so version 3.0.0 is in the `~/.rubies/ruby-3.0.0` folder. Gems for the version are in the `~/.gem/ruby/3.0.0/gems` folder.

If you wish to remove a Ruby version, you can run:

```bash
$ rm -rf ~/.rubies/ruby-3.0.0
$ rm -rf ~/.gem/ruby/ruby-3.0.0
```

### Uninstall Ruby (Homebrew)

If you have installed Ruby using Homebrew, you can uninstall with:

```bash
$ brew uninstall ruby
```

You can also remove the configuration from the  `.zshrc` file.

```bash
### ~/.zshrc~
if [ -d "/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```
