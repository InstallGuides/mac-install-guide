## Uninstall Ruby

How you uninstall Ruby on Mac will depend on how Ruby was installed. Entering the command `which -a ruby` will show you if more than one Ruby executable is installed. If you see `/usr/bin/ruby`, it is the ["system" Ruby](/faq/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby/index.html) which comes pre-installed on macOS to support scripting. Don't uninstall the system Ruby as it is there for macOS, not you. If Ruby was installed by Homebrew, you'll see `/usr/local/bin/ruby` (on Intel silicon) or  `/opt/homebrew/bin/ruby` (on Apple silicon). If Ruby was installed with rvm, it will be in `~/.rvm/rubies/` by default. If Ruby was installed with rbenv (actually `ruby-build`), it will be in `~/.rbenv/versions/` by default. If Ruby was installed with chruby (actually `ruby-install`), it will be in `~/rubies/` by default.

### Uninstall Ruby (rvm)

There are two ways to remove rubies from rvm:

* `rvm remove` removes Ruby and cleans up most of the install
* `rvm uninstall` removes only Ruby (leaves anything else)

`rvm uninstall` just removes the folder under `~/.rvm/rubies`. In most cases, you should use `rvm remove`. For example:

```bash
$ rvm list rubies
ruby-3.0.0
$ rvm remove ruby-3.0.0
```

See [Removing Rubies with rvm](https://rvm.io/rubies/removing).

### Uninstall Ruby (rbenv)

Use `rbenv versions` to see which versions you have installed.

Use the uninstall command to remove a version.

```bash
$ rbenv versions
3.0.0
$ rbenv uninstall 3.0.0
```

This will remove any gems associated with the version as well.

### Uninstall Ruby (Chruby)

Chruby installs versions of Ruby in the `~/.rubies/` folder, so version 3.0.0 is in the `~/.rubies/ruby-3.0.0` folder. Gems for the version are in the `~/.gem/ruby/3.0.0/gems` folder.

If you wish to remove a Ruby version, you can run:

```bash
$ rm -rf ~/.rubies/ruby-3.0.0
$ rm -rf ~/.gem/ruby/ruby-3.0.0
```

### Uninstall Ruby (Homebrew)

If you have installed Ruby using Homebrew, you can uninstall with:

```bash
$ brew uninstall ruby
```

You can also remove the configuration from the  `.zshrc` file.

```bash
### ~/.zshrc~
if [ -d "/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```

The `brew cleanup` command will remove outdated package versions. There is no command to uninstall a specific version.

### Uninstall Ruby (asdf)

If you have installed Ruby using asdf, first list all installed versions.

```bash
$ asdf list ruby
3.0.0
```

Then uninstall any version.

```bash
$ asdf uninstall ruby 3.0.0
```

## Tips: Uninstall Asdf

Here's how to remove asdf.

Remove the asdf configuration from the  `.zshrc` file:

```bash
. /usr/local/opt/asdf/asdf.sh
```

Remove all asdf files from your system:

```bash
$ rm -rf ~/.asdf/ ~/.tool-versions
```

Uninstall asdf from Homebrew:

```bash
$ brew uninstall --force asdf
```
