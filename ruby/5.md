## Asdf Version Manager

Most developers should install a software version manager before installing Ruby. It will help you manage multiple versions of Ruby. You will need to install newer Ruby versions as they are released. And you will need a version manager if you maintain older Ruby applications.

For a software version manager, I recommend [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). Asdf can manage versions of many languages, including Ruby and Node.

### Install dependencies

First, use Homebrew to install dependencies required by asdf.

```bash
$ brew install coreutils curl git
```

You'll also need the gnupg package if you need to install Node (if you need to develop with JavaScript in your local environment).

```bash
$ brew install gnupg
```

### Install asdf

You can install asdf using Homebrew.

```bash
$ brew install asdf
```

We must add asdf to the system environment before we can use it to manage Ruby versions.

### Add asdf to the .zshrc file

Use a shortcut to configure your shell to use asdf:

```bash
$ echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/asdf.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Check the `.zshrc` file.

```bash
$ cat ~/.zshrc
```

You should see configuration commands for asdf:

```bash
. /usr/local/opt/asdf/asdf.sh
```

Configuration for asdf should always be the last line in the `.zshrc` file, after setting any `$PATH` configuration.

ðŸš© Close and reopen the Terminal window for the changes to the `.zshrc` file to be recognized.

After closing and reopening the Terminal window, use `asdf --version` to check that asdf was installed successfully.

```bash
$ asdf --version
v0.8.0
```

### Add the .asdfrc configuration file

Add a `.asdfrc` configuration file to your user home directory to enable asdf to read `.ruby-version` files. This is helpful with projects that use a `.ruby-version` file to specify a Ruby version.

```bash
$ echo "legacy_version_file = yes" >> ~/.asdfrc
```

Confirm the creation of the configuration file.

```bash
$ cat ~/.asdfrc
legacy_version_file = yes
```

### Asdf `.tool-versions` file

When you work on a project, you can tell asdf which language versions you need by adding a `.tool-versions` file to your project folder. This is an alternative to configuration with the `.ruby-version` file that handles multiple languages.

```bash
ruby 3.0.0
nodejs 10.16.0
```

### More

The [Tips](/ruby/9.html) section explains how to remove asdf, if you decide not to use it.

Now you can install the newest Ruby version.
