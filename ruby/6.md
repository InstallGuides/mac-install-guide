## Install Ruby

Here are instructions for installing Ruby using asdf, the software version manager. First, be sure you've completed the section, [Asdf Version Manager](/install-rails-mac/4.html).

### Mac system Ruby

MacOS comes with a "system Ruby" pre-installed. MacOS Big Sur and Catalina include Ruby 2.6.3 which is not the newest version. Do not use the system Ruby (see [an article](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/psa-do-not-use-system-ruby) for why). You can see the system Ruby with `which ruby` and `ruby -v`.

Leave the system Ruby in place and use the software version manager to install the newest Ruby version.

### Install Ruby with asdf

Check online for the current [recommended version of Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

When this was written, Ruby 2.7.2 was the newest version. Ruby 3.0.0 was due to be released on Dec 25, 2020.

First, install the asdf plugin for Ruby:

```bash
$ asdf plugin add ruby
```

See all the versions of Ruby that are available:

```bash
$ asdf list all ruby
```

Install the latest version of Ruby:

```bash
$ asdf install ruby latest
```
Youâ€™ll see diagnostic messages and progress updates. Installation may take thirty minutes or more.

You need to specify a default version of Ruby in your home `~/.tool-versions` file. You can set the `~/.tool-versions` file with a command:

```bash
$ asdf global ruby 2.7.2
```

ðŸš© After installation, close and re-open the terminal window.

### Verify installation of Ruby

Verify that the newest version of Ruby is installed with `ruby -v`.

If you see Ruby version 2.6.3, it is the system Ruby and you likely forgot to close and re-open the terminal window.

If you see `No version set for command ruby`, you need to specify a default version of Ruby in your asdf `~/.tool-versions` file.

For example, create a `~/.tool-versions` file like this:

```bash
ruby 2.7.2
```

The [Tips](/install-rails-mac/19.html) section explains where Ruby versions are installed and how to remove them.

Next, you can optimize the Ruby development environment by updating gems.
