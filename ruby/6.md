## Update Gems

Experienced developers use a few tricks to optimize the Ruby development environment and keep it up to date. It's best if everything is up to date before you start a new project.

### Faster Gem Installation

By default, when you install gems, documentation files will be installed. Developers seldom use gem documentation files (they browse the web instead). Installing gem documentation files takes time, so many developers like to toggle the default so no documentation is installed.

Here's how to speed up gem installation by disabling the documentation step:

```bash
$ echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc
```

This adds the line `gem: --no-document` to a hidden `.gemrc` file in your home directory.

### Check the gem manager

[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubygems-update) is the package manager in Ruby. We use it to install software packages that add functionality to Ruby.

Check the installed gem manager version.

```bash
$ gem -v
3.2.3
```

You can check if a [newer RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubygems-update) version is available. Use `gem update --system` to upgrade the Ruby gem manager if your version is old:
```bash

$ gem update --system
```

### Updating gems

With Ruby, you’ve installed a collection of default gems that were current at the time of the Ruby release. It is likely some gems have been updated since the newest version of Ruby was released.

You can see a list of all gems installed with Ruby:

```bash
$ gem list
*** LOCAL GEMS ***
.
.
.
```

To get a list of gems that are outdated:

```bash
$ gem outdated
.
.
.
```

To update all stale gems:

```bash
$ gem update
Updating installed gems
.
.
.
```

You can track updates to gems at the RubyGems.org site by creating an account and visiting your [dashboard](https://rubygems.org/dashboard).

### Install Nokogiri

[Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) is a gem that is a dependency for many other gems. Nokogiri is a gem that requires compilation for your specific operating system (it’s one of the reasons we installed Xcode Command Line Tools). As such, if your system environment doesn't match Nokogiri's requirements, compilation of Nokogiri will fail. If your system is configured properly, you'll be able to compile Nokogiri. However, compilation takes time. Every time you install the Nokogiri gem, you'll wait (as long as five minutes).

To save time, install the Nokogiri gem:

```bash
$ gem install nokogiri
```

During installation, Nokogiri will display two lengthy messages in the console. It will also pause without displaying any progress for as long as five minutes while it builds the native extensions. Don't assume installation has failed unless you see an error message or you've waited more than ten minutes.

If Nokogiri installation fails, it's likely your Xcode Command Line Tools are not installed correctly. The Nokogiri maintainers provide instructions for [Installing Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html).

Everything is ready. You can begin developing applications with Ruby.
